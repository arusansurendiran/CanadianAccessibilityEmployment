Using spatial econometric techniques to analyze highway, air transport and railway infrastructure investments, this study finds that the employment effects of these investments vary widely across MSAs. Highway infrastructure is found to have positive, significant total effects on employment in most MSAs. Railway infrastructure investment has positive employment effects in MSAs with robust rail systems and high ridership. Air transport infrastructure investment results are mixed across MSAs and specification, but consistently provide small positive employment effects to landlocked Midwestern MSAs. Overall, highway infrastructure investment is found to provide the largest total effects on employment, but caution should be taken to account for spillover effects and other societal externalities related to transportation.},

Si bien la interacción entre el transporte y las economías de aglomeración está aceptada ampliamente, no hay suficiente investigación que intente una cuantificación empírica directa.

	abstract={Job accessibility is a measure of people, opportunities, and transportation system that are fundamental elements of urban spatial structure. Therefore, job accessibility can be used as a tool to understand urban spatial structure. Studying transit-based job accessibility can provide more insight into inner cities. To study transit-based job accessibility, a person-based approach is needed in order to take full consideration of the elements. However, person-based approaches are substantially restricted by the availability of individual trip data. This paper takes a simulation approach to study transit-based job accessibility. First, transit-dependent worker agents are generated using a population synthesis. Then the agents are enabled with job search and commuting capabilities. Once the agents are deployed in a commuting simulation, individual commuting trips are recorded. An individual job accessibility index is developed based on simulated commuting trips. The index is normalized with an expected value of 1.0 and a measurable uncertainty level, which makes it easy to interpret and suitable for cross-regional studies. A case study is conducted in Tucson, Arizona, where about 10,000 transit-dependent worker agents produce more than 600,000 individual commuting trips during morning and afternoon peak hours. Census block, group-level job accessibility shows a random spatial pattern that coincides with a dispersed urban spatial structure of the case study area.},

Using data on US metropolitan areas, this paper traces the links from transit service to central city employment density, urbanised area employment density and population; and from these physical agglomeration measures to average wages and per capita GMP. Significant indirect productivity effects of transit service are found. For example, in the case of central city employment density, estimated wage increases range between \$1.5 million and \$1.8 billion per metropolitan area yearly for a 10 per cent increase in transit seats or rail service miles per capita. Firms and households likely receive unanticipated agglomeration benefits from transit-induced densification and growth, and current benefit–cost evaluations may therefore underestimate the benefits of improving transit service, particularly in large cities with existing transit networks.},

The location of transit infrastructure distributes publicly-funded benefits to residents throughout a region. However, these benefits are not always distributed equally among different population groups. This research seeks to determine whether the benefits of Toronto’s public transit system are equitably distributed, and how these benefits change from 1996 to 2006 after the implementation of several transit projects in the region. We develop a methodology using a social indicator based on census tract level socio-economic characteristics to measure the relationship between social disadvantage and accessibility to jobs and transit travel time in the Toronto region over time. Transit equity is examined at three levels: spatially, temporally, and by job type. We find the range in accessibility and transit travel time narrows over the 10year period. In addition, the most socially disadvantaged census tracts have statistically significantly better accessibility and lower transit travel times relative to the rest of the region in both 1996 and in 2006. Our findings show that Toronto has a generally equitable transit system that benefits those in social need, who are likely to gain the most from transit. The methodology proposed presents a useful way to bring issues of social equity directly into the land use and transportation planning process.},

Urban cities are struggling with congested networks, noise and air pollution. Government agencies respond by investing in infrastructures to create integrated public transport systems. Transfers are a key element for the success of network integration. This study explores commuters’ perception of transfers by adopting Weber’s Law “Just Noticeable Difference”. Two trip attributes, travel time and cost, are investigated. Two stated-preference surveys are conducted at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. Results show that, on average, users’ desire at least a 33\% reduction in their current travel time and at least a 16\% reduction in their current travel cost given basic comfort amenities at the interchange. For an interchange with more comfort, on average, users’ desire at least a 25\% reduction in their current travel time and at least a 10\% reduction in their current travel cost. The findings are expected to be used as a guideline by planners when developing integrated public transport networks. Recommendations have been made to the Auckland Regional Public Transport Plan.},

	abstract={Urban transit systems in most American cities...have become a genuine civil rights issue-and a valid one-because the layout of rapid-transit systems determines the accessibility of jobs to the Black community. If transportation systems in American cities could be laid out so as to provide an opportunity for poor people to get meaningful employment, then they could begin to move into the mainstream of American life. A good example of this problem is my home city of Atlanta, where the rapid-transit system has been laid out for the convenience of the white upper-middle-class suburbanites who commute to their jobs downtown. The system has virtually no consideration for connecting the poor people with their jobs. There is only one possible explanation for this situation, and that is the racist blindness of city planners. Martin Luther King, Jr. (1986, pp. 325-326) Much attention is being paid to the role of public transit in employment-related mobility for urban residents, yet there is very little evidence of the degree to which one affects the other. Little research has focused on how labor participation is affected by increases in urban workers' access to public transportation. Research on the spatial mismatch hypothesis has dealt with the relationship between labor participation and the spatial separation of workers' residences from suitable jobs; however, most analyses concentrate on commuting time or distance as a function of auto use. Few studies have considered the impacts of public transportation on labor participation. This article describes a study analyzing the locations and employment characteristics of workers with varying levels of access to public transit. Using census data and a variety of spatial measures generated by a geographic information system (GIS), a two-stage least squares regression was used to estimate the relationship of access to public transit with labor participation levels for Portland, Oregon, and Atlanta, Georgia. The results suggest that access to public transit is a significant factor in determining average rates of labor participation within these two cities.},

	abstract={Millions of Canadians rely on public transportation to conduct daily activities and participate in the labour force. However, many low-income households are disadvantaged because existing public transit service does not provide them with sufficient access to destinations. Limited transit options, compounded with socioeconomic disadvantage, can result in transport poverty, preventing travel to important destinations, like employment opportunities. Given the growing gentrification of Canadian downtowns and the dispersion of poverty into Canadian suburbs, the time is right for a national accounting of those living in transport poverty, and the development of a national transport and land use strategy for alleviating the risks of accessibility deprivation. Accordingly, in this paper we measure and analyze vertical inequalities in access to employment in Canadian cities in order to estimate how many, where, and to what extent, Canadians are at risk of transport poverty. We make use of open transit network data and cutting edge accessibility measurement methods to generate comparative scores suitable for a national-scale analysis. We find that in aggregate, lower income neighbourhoods tend to have better levels of transit accessibility. But despite this overall positive outlook, there are still nearly one million low-income individuals living in urban areas with low transit accessibility. We summarize our findings by generating descriptive typologies for areas vulnerable to transport poverty which are then used to develop and recommend planning strategies to reduce inequalities. •We measure transit access to employment for Canada's eight largest cities.•We estimate where and to what extent Canadians are at risk of transport poverty.•Findings show low SES residents generally live in more accessible areas.•However, there are still nearly one million residents at risk of transport poverty.•A neighbourhood-scale cluster analysis is used to inform policy recommendations.},

	abstract={Linear mixed‐effects models are powerful tools for analysing complex datasets with repeated or clustered observations, a common data structure in ecology and evolution. Mixed‐effects models involve complex fitting procedures and make several assumptions, in particular about the distribution of residual and random effects. Violations of these assumptions are common in real datasets, yet it is not always clear how much these violations matter to accurate and unbiased estimation. Here we address the consequences of violations in distributional assumptions and the impact of missing random effect components on model estimates. In particular, we evaluate the effects of skewed, bimodal and heteroscedastic random effect and residual variances, of missing random effect terms and of correlated fixed effect predictors. We focus on bias and prediction error on estimates of fixed and random effects. Model estimates were usually robust to violations of assumptions, with the exception of slight upward biases in estimates of random effect variance if the generating distribution was bimodal but was modelled by Gaussian error distributions. Further, estimates for (random effect) components that violated distributional assumptions became less precise but remained unbiased. However, this particular problem did not affect other parameters of the model. The same pattern was found for strongly correlated fixed effects, which led to imprecise, but unbiased estimates, with uncertainty estimates reflecting imprecision. Unmodelled sources of random effect variance had predictable effects on variance component estimates. The pattern is best viewed as a cascade of hierarchical grouping factors. Variances trickle down the hierarchy such that missing higher‐level random effect variances pool at lower levels and missing lower‐level and crossed random effect variances manifest as residual variance. Overall, our results show remarkable robustness of mixed‐effects models that should allow researchers to use mixed‐effects models even if the distributional assumptions are objectively violated. However, this does not free researchers from careful evaluation of the model. Estimates that are based on data that show clear violations of key assumptions should be treated with caution because individual datasets might give highly imprecise estimates, even if they will be unbiased on average across datasets.},

	abstract={Encouraging the use of public transit is widely recognized as a viable solution to address urban transportation issues such as increasing congestion and pollution. Public transit is currently one of the most popular modes of transportation for commuting in metropolitan areas. Although numerous studies have developed methods to address job accessibility issues, overcrowding and long travel time issues in public transit commuting remain unresolved. Currently, the role of public transit in supporting job accessibility based on actual commuting demands has not been fully explored. This research aims to uncover the contribution of public transit to job accessibility from a network modeling perspective. Job accessibility and public transit services are evaluated and synthesized into an origin-destination (OD) network derived from real commuting demand extracted from big data. A graph convolutional network clustering method is applied to reveal the network characteristics of the public transit supportability for job accessibility. Urban function features are further analyzed to identify the potential improvement for poor job accessibility places. The results obtained through a case study in Shenzhen identify the regions where conflicts exist between job accessibility and the public transit supply. The analysis reveals specific deficiencies in job accessibility, offering a deeper understanding of the root causes of commuting issues. Possible solutions for improving public transit and land use to enhance job accessibility are discussed based on the empirical findings. The insights gained from this research are valuable for urban planning and transportation improvements aimed at addressing urban commuting challenges.},

When can these claims be made? We answer this question by first discussing design and estimation conditions under which model estimates can be interpreted, using the randomized experiment as the gold standard. We show how endogeneity – which includes omitted variables, omitted selection, simultaneity, common-method variance, and measurement error – renders estimates causally uninterpretable. Second, we present methods that allow researchers to test causal claims in situations where randomization is not possible or when causal interpretation could be confounded; these methods include fixed-effects panel, sample selection, instrumental variable, regression discontinuity, and difference-in-differences models. Third, we take stock of the methodological rigor with which causal claims are being made in a social sciences discipline by reviewing a representative sample of 110 articles on leadership published in the previous 10 years in top-tier journals. Our key finding is that researchers fail to address at least 66\% and up to 90\% of design and estimation conditions that make causal claims invalid.

	abstract = 	 {This research project examines the link between job access and stop/station level transit ridership. Job access, following recent literature, is measured as the number of jobs that can be reached within a 30-minute transit travel time, including transfers and walk time to access jobs once exiting a transit station. Cumulative opportunity job access measures of this sort—i.e., the number of jobs that can be reached within 30 minutes—have become common in the recent access literature, and those measures have often focused on access via transit. Yet there have been few studies that examine the link between transit job access and transit ridership, and of those none that examine the link at a station or stop level. This study uses station and stop level ridership data for the Los Angeles Metro bus and rail system and the BART rail system in the San Francisco Bay Area. The research team calculated transit job access as jobs that can be reached within 30 minutes, using the Remix software tool. Regression analysis of 1,000 randomly selected Los Angeles bus stops reveals a robust relationship between stop-level ridership and job access. The association between transit job access and bus stop ridership (embarkations and disembarkations at the stop) is statistically significant. Converting that association into an elasticity, if the number of jobs accessible within 30-minutes were to increase by 1 percent, on average stop-level ridership would increase between 0.6 to 0.8 percent. The same association, with similar magnitudes, exists for Metro rail stations and BART rail stations, but due the smaller sample sizes, those relationships are not statistically significant when control variables are added to the regression. The findings show that job access is closely related to ridership at the bus stop level, suggesting transit agencies can increase job access by increasing bus frequency, reducing transfers, siting lines that connect job concentrations to residents, and by improvi}

	abstract={Access to opportunities through public transport can have different impacts on individual's life especially in developing countries where opportunities are limited, job informality rates are high, and socioeconomic characteristics gaps are big. The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between job informality and accessibility to employment by public transport in São Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR), Brazil. To do so, we calculate a cumulative-opportunity measure of accessibility to jobs for 633 areas within the SPMR. We use a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model to estimate the effect of job accessibility on the likelihood of being informally employed, controlling for individual and other area characteristics. To account for informal sector heterogeneity, two regression models are generated: one for the workers earning below minimum wage and one for the workers earning above minimum wage. The results show that accessibility to jobs is unevenly distributed across the region, largely concentrated in the core of the region, and especially in the high-income areas. The regression results show that for workers earning less than the minimum wage, a higher level of accessibility to jobs by public transport is associated with a lower likelihood of being a worker in the informal job sector. For informal workers earning more than the minimum wage, car ownership seem to be more relevant than transit accessibility in determining the likelihood of being part of the informal job sector. In light of these findings, increasing accessibility by public transport through either expanding transit services to areas with high informality rates to have a better access to formal jobs or supporting the decentralization of formal jobs may be a way to achieve reductions in informality rates, especially among those earning less than the minimum wage.},

The role of public transportation in employment appears in two policy debates regarding the spatial mismatch hypothesis and the role of public or private mobility to help the unemployed to gain employment. However, research studies dealing with the two debates produced conflicting results, and the impact of public transit has not been fully accounted for in explaining employment outcomes. A study was done to disaggregate analysis to explain employment status of individuals in the Houston, Texas, metropolitan area as a function of the access to public transit, job accessibility by transit, and household car ownership. The results of the study indicate that job accessibility by public transit has significant impacts on employment levels. However, it is questionable if improving physical access to public transit can significantly help the poor, although it may be effective for enhancing the employment levels of individuals with regular access to private vehicles. Although private mobility also appears significant for improving employment status of the economically disadvantaged, job accessibility by public transit has a stronger effect in increasing the levels of employment than private vehicles. The study defies the contention that public transit is helpless for the underprivileged of the society. Therefore, it is important to continue policy efforts in progress to improve regional public transit service.},

São Paulo, New York, and Tokyo were selected to perform the analysis. A Fractional Logistic Regression in the binary form was drawn, and a competitive travel time index was calculated based on the Car/Public transit travel time ratio weighted by the number of the employed population at the origin and jobs at destinations in the absence of an Origin-Destination matrix. Findings suggest that, though car ownership was identified as the major factor, Car/Public transit travel time ratio is positively associated with the increase of public transit modal share.

The use of public transport is directly associated with a reduced environmental impact for satisfying daily mobility needs. Current research has focused on identifying the factors affecting the use of public transport, elements such as age, car ownership, travel distance, or parking availability having been associated with a direct impact on an individual’s transport mode choice. However, most of these studies focused on the travel behaviour of individuals living in large cities, where the population density is high, and public transport is usually more developed than in small cities and towns. The present study provides additional insights into the impact of eleven different factors on the use of public transport by employees living and working in networks of small cities and towns in Northern Europe. The study uses ordered logistic regression to analyse the data collected in 2019 through a regional travel survey conducted in Agder, Norway. The results reveal that the choice of public transport as a daily commute mode is significantly affected by car ownership, distance to work, parking availability, and ticket prices. Additionally, the results indicate that the odds of employees using public transport increase when the respondents do not have persons in care. On the other hand, factors such as low bus frequency and long walking distances to the home bus stop show a negative impact on the use of public transport. Based on these results, regional and local policy actions are proposed.},

	title={Evaluating Job Accessibility and Equity by Public Transport: Evidence From the Fifteen Largest Cities in the United States},
	note={ID: cdi_proquest_journals_3066163529},
	abstract={The concept of accessibility, referring to the degree of ease in reaching destinations, is currently gaining traction in both academic literature and practical applications. The predominant metric utilized to assess accessibility, namely the cumulative opportunity measure, is frequently calculated by quantifying the number of job opportunities that can be feasibly accessed within a certain time. Disparities in accessibility between users of different modes of transportation occur frequently and are largely attributable to the uneven distribution of resources across the metropolitan area. In order for urban residents to take advantage of the many social and economic opportunities available to them, they need access to dependable transportation networks, including public transit. To improve transportation sustainability, environmental quality, public health, and economic well-being, people should take public transit on foot or two wheels. Social exclusion is exacerbated by inadequate mobility options; hence transportation and land use policies prioritize providing equitable access to transit. Accessibility and equity considerations can improve transportation policy and design. Underserved communities, low-wage households, and the unemployed need public transportation to access services. The act of combining all available job opportunities may lead to an overestimation of the potential employment options accessible to socially disadvantaged individuals. This, in turn, has the potential to contribute to or create suboptimal policy choices. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate the accessibility to all jobs as well as low-wage employment opportunities for the disadvantaged populations via public transportation. It also analyzes the equity situation provided by public transportation in terms of accessibility to jobs. In order to achieve its objectives, the study gathered a diverse array of data at the census tract level from the fifteen largest cities in the United States based on population. This data included information on the total number of jobs, low-wage jobs, public transit network and schedule, median household income, unemployment rate, migration rate within the last five years, and housing rent cost exceeding 30\% of total household income. The cumulative opportunity measure is utilized to compute the spatial pattern of job distribution, network interconnectivity, and job availability. Equity can be assessed through two distinct approaches, namely the conventional Gini index and Lorenz curve, as well as the vertical equity indicator. The evaluation was conducted on the census tracts level, providing more detailed observations at a finer resolution. The present study investigates socio-economic disparities pertaining to income, unemployment rate, migration rate, and housing rent by analyzing the accessibility scores of census tracts.The result indicates that the accessibility situation through public transit in the 15 largest cities. With the exception of New York City, Chicago, and Philadelphia, the majority of the 15 largest cities in the United States lack a well-developed public transportation infrastructure. The spatial allocation of job opportunities tends to be concentrated in specific areas within cities, often resulting in limited accessibility via public transportation in many municipalities. Encouragingly, several major cities have prioritized the development of enhanced public transportation infrastructure, a crucial component of sustainable transportation that warrants emulation by other locales. The analysis of equity with respect to socioeconomic variables reveals that the accessibility of employment opportunities for marginalized groups remains suboptimal. Individuals who rely heavily on public transport face significant challenges in accessing employment opportunities. While certain cities make efforts to reduce the disparity, the majority of the cities continue to fall short in this regard. City planners and decision-makers should put a strong emphasis on providing enough resources for public transport and equitable opportunities for everyone to use transit to get to their individual workplaces. The findings of the study are expected to aid planners and policymakers to suggest more precise interventions aimed at enhancing the standard of living of the most susceptible groups within their respective cities. The study facilitates the ability to make direct comparisons regarding the effects of varying levels of accessibility across different cities, with the aim of establishing equitable transportation options in the domains of land use and transportation planning.},

The most common accessibility metric, the cumulative opportunity measure, is often computed as the number of jobs that can be reached within a certain time frame. Aggregating all jobs, however, often inflates the opportunities that can be reached by socially vulnerable residents, which could feed into and/or generate inadequate policy decisions. This study therefore develops the measure of accessibility to low-income jobs for vulnerable residents by public transport, specifically taking into account realized travel times by these vulnerable individuals. This fine-grained measure, computed across 11 major Canadian cities, is a modified place-based accessibility metric that incorporates facets of person-based metrics, allowing planners and policy makers to propose more targeted interventions to improve the quality of life of their cities' most vulnerable populations. The study further allows for direct comparisons between the impacts of variation in accessibility levels between different regions to help create best practices in land use and transport planning.},

	abstract={The role of transport in providing access to employment has received considerable attention. Since transport policies may be motivated by assumed effects on employment probability outcomes, it is important to establish the nature of the relationship between transport and employment outcomes. While the majority of the empirical evidence suggests a positive association, it is not conclusive or consistent and often shows mixed results. To address this confusion, our study has systematically reviewed this evidence base and synthesised it through meta-analysis. We first identified 93 studies that quantitatively assessed the impact of transport on employment outcomes. By systematically merging the empirical evidence, this study establishes a positive association between transport and employment outcomes, with varying effects for four identified categories of transport measures (or combinations thereof): car ownership, public transport access, commute times, and job accessibility levels. This positive association persists in studies that control for endogeneity between transport and employment, but a larger evidence base is needed to establish a more robust relationship, in particular for cities and smaller (rural) areas outside the US-context and with regard to public transport. We then selected 20 methodologically comparable studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Our meta-regression models clearly demonstrate that car ownership significantly increases individual employment probabilities, in particular among welfare recipients. Young drivers benefit from access to household cars when these are not in use by their parents, and they are more sensitive to the time and cost implications of longer commutes. While our systematic review suggests that better access to public transport and higher levels of job accessibility increases employment probabilities, meta-regression analysis requires more consistent transport measures. The findings in this study are important for policymakers in that they imply that job seekers may benefit from public policies targeted at improving their access to public transport, in particular for people without access to cars and in areas with fewer job opportunities.},

This paper examines the short-run impacts of rapid employment growth on travel time to work. We exploit exogenous variation in employment levels resulting from movements of military troops during the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) in order to identify the effect of employment growth on travel time using difference-in-difference-in-differences and instrumental variable methods. Our results show that for each additional 10 workers added per square kilometer, travel time increases by 0.171 to 0.244min per one-way commute trip per commuter in the short run, which equates to \$0.07 to \$0.20 in travel time cost per commuter per day. Our estimates imply that the annualized short-run congestion costs of the 2005 BRAC were \$79 to \$761 million per year (in constant 2005 dollars) for military commuters and \$3.15 to \$6.3 billion per year (in constant 2005 dollars) for civilian commuters in BRAC-affected areas. •We examine the short-run impacts of rapid employment growth on travel time to work.•We exploit exogenous variation in employment levels from the 2005 BRAC.•We use DDD and IV methods.•Adding 10workers/km2 costs a commuter \$0.07 to \$0.20 per day in travel time costs.•The 2005 BRAC cost civilian commuters \$3.15 to \$6.3 billion per year.},

	abstract={Public transport improvements may increase economic productivity if they enable the growth and densification of cities, downtowns, or industrial clusters and thereby increase external agglomeration economies. It has been argued that the potential agglomeration benefits are large; if so, understanding them better would be useful in making funding decisions about public transport improvements. We reviewed theoretical and empirical literature on agglomeration as well as a small number of articles on transportation's role in agglomeration. The theoretical literature is useful in understanding possible avenues by which transportation improvements might affect agglomeration, although there is little discussion of public transport specifically. Relevant empirical studies tend to focus on metropolitan regions and use a generalized measure of transportation cost. But public transport impacts on agglomeration are likely to be different from road investment impacts. We identified several ways of conducting research building on this literature that would help evaluate the agglomeration impacts of public transport proposals: tracing the links between transport, agglomeration, and productivity; better motivating research using theories of agglomeration mechanisms; taking scale and redistribution into account; exploring the functional form of agglomeration economies; accounting for endogeneity in model structure; and considering development context.},

	abstract={Cities worldwide are pursuing policies to reduce car use and prioritise public transit (PT) as a means to tackle congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. The increase of PT ridership is constrained by many aspects; among them, travel time and the built environment are considered the most critical factors in the choice of travel mode. We propose a data fusion framework including real-time traffic data, transit data, and travel demand estimated using Twitter data to compare the travel time by car and PT in four cities (São Paulo, Brazil; Stockholm, Sweden; Sydney, Australia; and Amsterdam, the Netherlands) at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We use real-world data to make realistic estimates of travel time by car and by PT and compare their performance by time of day and by travel distance across cities. Our results suggest that using PT takes on average 1.4–2.6 times longer than driving a car. The share of area where travel time favours PT over car use is very small: 0.62\% (0.65\%), 0.44\% (0.48\%), 1.10\% (1.22\%) and 1.16\% (1.19\%) for the daily average (and during peak hours) for São Paulo, Sydney, Stockholm, and Amsterdam, respectively. The travel time disparity, as quantified by the travel time ratio R (PT travel time divided by the car travel time), varies widely during an average weekday, by location and time of day. A systematic comparison between these two modes shows that the average travel time disparity is surprisingly similar across cities: R < 1 for travel distances less than 3 km, then increases rapidly but quickly stabilises at around 2. This study contributes to providing a more realistic performance evaluation that helps future studies further explore what city characteristics as well as urban and transport policies make public transport more attractive, and to create a more sustainable future for cities.},

	note={ID: cdi_proquest_journals_2586372238},
	abstract={Even though workers in the UK spent just 1,000 pounds on commuting in 2017, the economic loss may be far higher because of the congestion externality arising from the way in which one worker's commute affects the commuting time of others. I provide empirical evidence that commuting time affects job acceptance, pointing to large indirect costs of congestion. To interpret the empirical facts and quantify the costs of congestion, I build a model featuring a frictional labor market within a metropolitan area. By endogenizing commuting congestion in a labor search model, the model connects labor market responses to urban policies. Workers evaluate job offers based on their productivity and commuting costs, taking congestion as given, but by accepting and commuting to distant jobs, affect other workers' labor market outcomes. Through this mechanism, equilibrium moving decisions, housing rent, and wages are tightly linked to congestion. Calibrating the model to the local labor market around London, I show that the effect of the congestion externality is to significantly decrease welfare and increase wage inequality. I quantify the effects of a congestion tax on labor market outcomes, and show that the welfare-maximizing tax has substantial negative effects on inequality, but comes at a cost of higher unemployment.},

	abstract={In this paper, we study the commuting behavior of citizens living in or near a city who must decide how to get to work. Such citizens can use their own car and drive to work or they can take public transport. The two public transport options we consider are the bus and train. In this context, we perform two tasks. First, we analyze the choice of car versus train. We calculate the deadweight loss from the negative externality (traffic congestion) generated by car travel and then discuss how a toll can achieve the efficient allocation of commuters between the car and train modes of transport. Second, we analyze the choice of car versus bus. Again, we calculate the deadweight loss from the traffic congestion resulting from car travel and discuss how a toll can achieve the efficient allocation of commuters between the car and bus modes of transport, which would benefit all commuters. En este artículo se estudia el comportamiento de los desplazamientos al trabajo de los ciudadanos que viven en una ciudad, o cerca de ella, y que deben decidir cómo ir al trabajo. Estos ciudadanos pueden utilizar su propio coche y conducir hasta el trabajo o pueden tomar el transporte público. Las dos opciones de transporte público que se consideran son el autobús y el tren. En este contexto, se realizaron dos tareas. En primer lugar, se analizó la elección del coche frente al tren. Se calculó la pérdida de peso muerto derivada de la externalidad negativa (congestión del tráfico) generada por los viajes en coche y, a continuación, se analizó cómo un peaje puede lograr un reparto eficiente de los viajeros entre los modos de transporte en coche y en tren. En segundo lugar, se analizó la elección del coche frente al autobús. Una vez más, se calculó la pérdida de peso muerto derivada de la congestión del tráfico resultante de los viajes en coche y se analizó cómo un peaje puede lograr un reparto eficiente de los viajeros entre los modos de transporte de coche y autobús, que beneficiaría a todos los viajeros. 本稿では、都市あるいはその近郊に住む、通勤手段を選択しなければならない市民の通勤行動を検討する。このような市民は、自分の車で通勤したり、公共交通機関を利用したりすることができる。我々はバスと電車を公共交通機関の2つの選択肢として考える。このコンテキストで、2つのタスクを実施する。最初に、自動車対電車の選択を分析する。自動車での移動によって発生する負の外部性 (交通渋滞)から死重損失を計算し、ある損失がどのようにして、自動車または電車の交通手段での通勤者の効率的配分を達成できるかを考察する。次に、自動車対バスの選択を分析する。これも、自動車での移動によって生じる交通渋滞による死重損失を計算し、損失がどのようにして自動車またはバスの交通手段での通勤者の効率的配分を達成でき、すべての通勤者に利益をもたらすかを考察する。},

	abstract={Lack of access to affordable transportation has been hypothesized to be a barrier to employment among low-wage workers. We build a structural job search model to investigate how commuting costs influence the employment decisions of low-wage workers in the United States, and whether differences in commuting by race and education can explain observed disparities in employment. We find that commuting itself poses a significant barrier to overall low-wage employment, as the associated costs are high relative to potential wages. However, we find that inter-group differences in commuting costs account for a much smaller fraction of inter-group employment disparities than do differences in other labor market factors such as the wage offer distribution and offer arrival rates. •We investigate commuting as an employment barrier for low-wage workers and as a source for disparities by race, education, and gender.•Commuting costs explain about 2–4 percentage points of the unemployment rate for individuals with at most a high school degree.•Potential commutes do not vary substantially across racial and educational groups.•Differences in job offer quality better explain racial and educational employment disparities.},

Evidence on migrants and the cross effect between urban status and experience implies that a significant fraction of the urban wage premium accrues to workers over time and stays with them when they leave cities. Therefore, a portion of the urban wage premium is a wage growth, not a wage level, effect. This evidence suggests that cities speed the accumulation of human capital.},

	abstract={In the Northern hemisphere, low-income transit users typically take shorter trips and use buses in a greater proportion, but there is limited knowledge on inequalities in the detailed characteristics of public transit trips. In this paper, we seek to understand and explain differences in segment components of transit trips across socio-economic groups. Trip components include access time, wait time, total travel time, overall trip speed and percent of trip time spent in access and wait (off-vehicle time). Using the Montreal metropolitan region travel survey (2013), we focus on the 46,186 transit trips made by 20,138 individuals for which household income was available. This data is augmented by time estimations of the aforementioned trip components, and combined with trips specific transit service measures calculated using General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS). We first assess the relationship between trip components and income using descriptive statistics. OLS regressions are then conducted to identify which individual and transport-based factors contribute to variations in trip component outcomes. Low-income transit users take more transit trips (especially bus and Metro) than their higher income counterparts and combine multiple transit modes through more frequent transfers. While average access and wait time are individually lower than those for trips of wealthier respondents, low-income total trip time is similar but trip speed is considerably lower. Lower-income populations also spend a greater share of their trips in access and wait time due to service and trip discrepancies including trip timing, proximity to metro stations and requirement for transfers. When controlling for other factors, the conditions under which trips by low-income individuals are taken mainly drive income differences.},

	abstract={Transportation economics studies show that the activity density, in particular, employment density, is influenced by availability and quality of transportation infrastructure and services, including public transit. These studies also show that businesses and economic activities may have unique requirements, preferences, and characteristics, which may lead to varying effect of transportation on different sectors. However, the relationship between transit infrastructure and employment density has been examined mostly using simple transit proximity distance or travel time in the past research and few have used transit accessibility, and none have accounted for first/last mile (FMLM) modality, different public transit service type, and job matching mechanisms. This study attempts to fill these gaps by utilizing a new accessibility measure that is adaptive to the aforesaid features and comparing its relationship with employment density across various industries. The results show a positive and significant relationship between employment density and bus service accessibility for all industrial sectors, while the effect of light rail service is significant only for finance, real estate, insurance, food, and accommodation industrial sectors, and when FMLM modality is driving. Proximity to public transit was found to be a stronger predictor of job density than accessibility. Additionally, the effect of closeness to highway network was almost twice the effect of transit proximity for all sectors, especially for blue-collar jobs. The results also highlight that industrial sectors tend to cluster in areas with higher employment diversity but are indifferent towards higher land use diversity. These results signify several challenges in transportation equity and multimodal planning and policies. Improving regional public transit integration through coordinated physical infrastructure, fare systems, and schedules, along with enhancing walking amenities in key areas, could improve connectivity between activities. Additionally, incorporating equity considerations into land use planning, such as through distributional impact analysis, can help monitor and ensure equity in future urban developments.},

	abstract={The present paper analyses the temporary stability of commuting to workplace functions in the face of changes in workers' and firms' characteristics and the local labour market conditions. To do this, we estimate commuting functions by incorporating four types of determinants: the characteristics of the workers, the jobs (or hiring firms), and the municipalities where the workers reside and work, including the unemployment rates to account for disequilibria in their respective local labour markets. After developing a simple model, we estimate these functions based on labour commuting microdata obtained from the population census of Spain for the years 2001 and 2011, periods with important changes in the labour market situation. We estimate commuting functions by means of ordered probit functions. The results show that the duration of commutes has not changed drastically. Additionally, most of the incorporated determinants maintain their sign and change their intensity only slightly over time. The duration of commutes is greater in the case of men, singles, educated and foreign workers, living in rented housing, using public transport, living or working in large cities, and working in large firms. In the same way, commutes are longer when the worker's municipality of residence has a high unemployment rate, and they turn out to be shorter when the municipality of the workplace has a low unemployment rate. Finally, the changes in the unemployment rate, especially in the municipality of residence, have been compensated by variation in their respective parameters, consequently offsetting their effects on commute times.},

	abstract = 	 {Previous research has proved the existence of a causal relationship between the concentration of jobs in a city and the income of inhabitants. Other researchers have studied the close and nearly causal relationship between those variables and the infrastructure such as highways in different zones of a city. Nevertheless, no one study has taken into account the degree to which each area of a city benefits from the latest improvements to public transport. The aim of this research is to analyse the relationship between the size of the labour market, the income and the employment concentration with respect to improvements to public transport (Transmilenio) in Bogota. The degree of enhancement of public transport in a zone is suspected to be endogenous. Through the use of OLS estimations and then 2SLS, the validation of endogeneity provides sufficient tools to infer causality of improvement of public transport. The size of companies, defined by the number of jobs they offer, plays the role of instrumental variable. In essence, the number of jobs, the size of the labour market and income are largely defined by the level of improvement to urban public transport in each zone of the city but the causality relationship changes depending on the size of companies established in each zone. In the case of Bogota, public transport improvements seams to have a causality relationship with the income of inhabitants in each zone and the number of jobs, and this changes with respect to the size of enterprises. In contrast, the size of the labour market, defined as the number of jobs reachable in a specific time, is not determined by the degree of the presence of public transport enhancement.},

The theory of spatial mismatch has been proposed for more than sixty years, and its theoretical connotation has been continuously expanded through the heated debate on its objective existence. However, due to the lack of understanding of its expansion process and the essence of its theoretical connotation, its theoretical meaning is ambiguous and fails to truly guide its role in practice. Based on the structural analysis of the connotation of spatial mismatch, this study summarizes the theoretical evolution and empirical development of spatial mismatch from four levels: “objects of concern-influencing factors-spatial relations-consequential effects”. It is found that after half a century of evolution, the study of spatial mismatch has formed a relatively perfect theoretical and methodological system, and in the process of expansion, spatial mismatch has been given a deeper meaning, which can provide an important theoretical and practical reference for solving the separation of residential and spatial resources and the resultant welfare loss effects.},
